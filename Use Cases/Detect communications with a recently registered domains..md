# Обзор

Primarily focused on providing high-level information, references, and background.


## Name

A succinct statement that describes intention of the use case (e.g. Detect Communication with a Known-Bad IP). 


## Problem Statement

Describes the problem, beginning with any necessary background information.


## Objectives

Defines the goals of the use case. Includes measurable time frames.


## Compliance

List applicable compliance items this use case aims to partially or fully meet.


## MITRE ATT&CK Framework

Describes which of the Mitre ATT&CK Framework Tactics/Techniques the objectives should allow detection of.

## Assumptions and Limitations

Describes any assumptions/limitations regarding law, licensing, policies, or technicalities.


# Analysis

Insight on the actions of and tools for those who are expected to monitor and respond.


## Monitoring and Notifications

Describes how analysts will monitor or be notified of activity. This typically involves monitors, dashboards, reports, emails, alerts, etc. Include alternative/backup methods when applicable.


## Recommended Response Action(s)

Describes which actions should be taken with the information provided - typically alerts or simply observing something anomalous.


# Engineering

The necessary steps and content construction that fulfills the use case. If the entire monitoring/alerting solution were replaced, this section should allow complete reconstruction.


## Component Names

The base components that provide business logic, display, and notification. 
- Include the expected source log makeup and example.
- Use a word like "Suspicious" to indicate that the fidelity is lower, therefore some false positives may result.
- Group alerts/queries into a single use case when they share common objectives/recommended response actions.


### Alert [Name]

- Filter
- Grouping
- Severity
- Threshold
  - Event Count
  - Time Window
- Category/Normalization
- Tags
- Fidelity (high means no false positives)


### Query [Name]

- Query String
- Fidelity (high means no false positives)
- Query Explanation


## Data Stream Analysis

Pseudocode-like logic flow of how events are processed by the SIEM and presented or alerted upon. When possible, include a visual representation of some sort.


## Validation

Methods to ensure the use case was developed and is operating properly. These can be pass/fail, time based, or other relevant measurements. When possible, include an automated script or manual steps to cause the alert to fire on demand (i.e. attack simulation)


### Attack Simulation

Specific actions to reproduce events that are expected to be detected/highlighted by use case components.


## References and Resources
Any useful resources or references that can help understand the vulnerability, attack, detection, affected software, protocols, etc.
