# Newly registred domains (NRDs)
## Overwiew
Threat actors often prefer to use newly registered domains (NRDs) as a means to launch malicious campaigns. As a best security practice, it is recommended to block or closely monitor NRDs in enterprise traffic.

## Usage
### Kaspersky CyberTrace
[nrd-list-downloader](https://github.com/kmssrv/nrd-list-downloader)  is a shell script that automatically downloads, decompresses, and aggregates Newly Registered Domain (NRD) lists fromÂ [WhoisDS.com](https://www.whoisds.com/newly-registered-domains). Script generates a clean .csv file that is formatted for use with Kaspersky CyberTrace.
